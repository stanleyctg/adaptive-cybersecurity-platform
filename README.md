A platform to detect and block malicious IPs using threat intelligence and machine learning.

# Adaptive Cybersecurity Platform

## Description
A platform designed to detect and block malicious IP addresses in real time using:
- Threat intelligence APIs (AbuseIPDB, MaxMind GeoIP).
- Machine learning for adaptive anomaly detection.

## Goals
- Integrate threat intelligence APIs for real-time IP detection.
- Build a secure, tamper-proof logging system.
- Visualize malicious traffic origins and trends.
- Incorporate ML for adaptive threat detection.

## Current Status
**Day 1**: Environment setup and initial commit.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Install Python and Node.js dependencies.
3. Follow the documentation for database and API setup.
